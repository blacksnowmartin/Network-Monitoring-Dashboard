Project Features:

Device Status: Display the online/offline status of network devices with color-coded indicators.

Bandwidth Usage: Monitor and display the current bandwidth usage for each network device.

Latency Monitoring: Ping network devices at regular intervals and display latency statistics.

Traffic Analysis: Visualize network traffic patterns with graphs and charts, including top talkers and protocols.

Alerting: Implement alerting mechanisms to notify administrators via email or SMS when certain network thresholds are exceeded (e.g., high latency, low bandwidth, device offline).

Device Details: Provide detailed information about each network device, including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and device type.

Historical Data: Store historical data for performance analysis and trend visualization.

User Authentication: Implement user authentication to ensure only authorized personnel can access the dashboard.

Tools and Technologies:

Programming Language: Choose a language like Python or JavaScript for the backend and frontend development.

Web Framework: Use a web framework like Flask (Python) or Express.js (Node.js) for building the dashboard interface.

Database: Consider using a database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store historical data.

Network Monitoring Tools: Utilize libraries or tools to collect network data (e.g., SNMP for device status, Ping for latency).

Visualization: Use charting libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js) for visualizing network metrics.

Alerting: Implement email or SMS alerting using third-party APIs or libraries.

GitHub Repository Structure:

README.md: Provide detailed documentation on how to set up and use the network monitoring dashboard.

Code Files: Organize your code into appropriate directories (e.g., frontend, backend, database).

Sample Configuration: Include sample configuration files to set up devices and alerts.

Screenshots: Add screenshots or images of the dashboard in action.

License: Include an open-source license (e.g., MIT License) to specify how others can use and contribute to your project.

Benefits:

This project will showcase your skills in network engineering, web development, and data visualization.
It can be a valuable tool for network administrators to monitor and manage their network infrastructure.
